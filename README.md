Pulpit Rock Keyboard is a project to combine the parts I like the best on the [Plaid keyboard](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid) and the [Corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), to create something new which both feels and looks good. The keyboard gets it's name from the [Preacher’s Chair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preikestolen) which is located in Norway, because split keyboards remind me of fjords and Preacher’s Chair is one of the most beautiful places I know of.

The goal is to create a split ortholinear keyboard that:
  - Feels comfortable
  - Looks amazing
  - Only has the most important keys and keeps everything else in layers
